# Flash Sale System

A high-throughput flash sale system designed to handle massive spikes in traffic while ensuring fairness and no overselling.

## üéØ Design Choice & Trade-offs

This system is designed with **high throughput, low latency, and fairness** in mind. Key design choices include:

| Component            | Choice                                  | Trade-offs                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Monorepo             | **Nx**                                  | Organizes API, web and scripts as separate apps/libs on a single repository. Trade-off: adds learning curve for new user.    |
| Web Framework        | **Fastify (Node.js)**                   | Extremely fast, lightweight. Trade-off: less built-in structure than NestJS.                                                 |
| Request Handling     | **Queue-based ordering via RabbitMQ**   | Ensures ordered processing and prevents DB overload. Trade-off: slight delay in processing as requests go through the queue. |
| Inventory Management | **Redis atomic decrement**              | Prevents overselling. Trade-off: requires syncing stock to DB asynchronously.                                                |
| Rate Limiting        | **User ID-based token bucket in Redis** | Fairness per user. Trade-off: requires distributed store and adds slight overhead.                                           |
| Caching              | **Redis**                               | Reduces database load and latency. Trade-off: must handle cache invalidation carefully.                                      |
| Workers              | **RabbitMQ consumers processing queue** | Horizontal scalability and resilience. Trade-off: must handle retries and failed message processing.                         |
| Package Manager      | **PNPM**                                | Disk space savings by using symlinks. Trade-off: some legacy tooling may expect `node_modules` layout of npm/yarn.           |
